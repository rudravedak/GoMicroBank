## Overview

GoMicroBank aims to redefine banking by offering a robust platform that efficiently handles microservices architecture. The system is built to support high transaction volumes while ensuring security and reliability. By leveraging modern technologies, we create a seamless banking experience for users.

## Features

- **High Performance**: Built on Go, the platform can handle numerous transactions per second.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Each component operates independently, ensuring easy scalability.
- **Real-time Processing**: Kafka allows for real-time event streaming, enhancing user experience.
- **Containerization**: Docker simplifies deployment and management of services.
- **Cloud-Native**: Designed to run on cloud environments, ensuring flexibility and resilience.

## Technologies

This project incorporates several key technologies:

- **Go**: The primary programming language for backend services.
- **Docker**: Used for containerization, making it easier to deploy applications.
- **Kubernetes**: Manages container orchestration, ensuring services run smoothly.
- **Kafka**: Provides real-time event streaming capabilities.
- **gRPC**: Facilitates efficient communication between microservices.
- **Ingress-Nginx**: Manages external access to the services.
- **KrakenD**: API Gateway that consolidates microservices.
- **Protocol Buffers**: For efficient serialization of structured data.

## Architecture

The architecture of GoMicroBank consists of several microservices, each responsible for a specific function. The services communicate via gRPC and Kafka, ensuring efficient data exchange. The following diagram illustrates the architecture:

1. **User Service**: Manages user accounts and authentication.
2. **Transaction Service**: Handles all banking transactions.
3. **Notification Service**: Sends alerts and notifications to users.
4. **Reporting Service**: Generates reports based on user activity and transactions.

## Getting Started

To get started with GoMicroBank, you will need to have a few prerequisites installed on your machine:

- Go (version 1.16 or higher)
- Docker
- Kubernetes (Minikube or a cloud provider)
- Kafka

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rudravedak/GoMicroBank.git
   cd GoMicroBank
   ```

2. **Build Docker Images**:

   Each microservice has its own Dockerfile. You can build all images with:

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

3. **Start Services**:

   Use Docker Compose to start the services:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

4. **Access the Application**:

   After the services are running, you can access the application through your browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

5. **Download and Execute Releases**:

   For the latest stable release, visit [GoMicroBank Releases](https://github.com/rudravedak/GoMicroBank/releases). Download the appropriate files and follow the instructions to execute them.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with the API. Here are some basic commands:

### Create a User

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/users \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com"}'
```

### Make a Transaction

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/transactions \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"userId": "1", "amount": 100, "type": "deposit"}'
```

### Get User Transactions

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/users/1/transactions
```
